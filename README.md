# edge_token_verifier

Experimental token verifier that works on the Edge.

Hello there! This is an early stage experimental Deno module to verify tokens on edge runtime.
We are also experimenting with [`dnt`](https://github.com/denoland/dnt) to create the the Node.js compatible module.

We are currently testing the module on different edge runtimes. The current releases are only for testing purposes.
